Building a Community Where Learning is Free for Everyone
Discover how SkillShare Academy connects learners worldwide through our innovative credit-based mentorship system and accessible education


--- Mission & Vision ---
Our Mission
To provide completely free, high-quality education for everyone through our innovative credit-based mentorship system and accessible learning resources. Learners earn credits by completing courses and skill assessments, then use these credits to access personalized mentorship sessions. We believe that financial barriers should never prevent anyone from learning new skills, advancing their career, or pursuing their passions.

Our Vision
To create an inclusive global learning community where knowledge flows freely through our credit-based system, volunteer mentors share their expertise with dedicated learners who have demonstrated commitment through earned credits, and everyone has access to skill assessment tools that help them grow - regardless of their economic situation, background, or location.

Our Community Story

Founded in 2019 by volunteers who believed education should be free for everyone, SkillShare Academy emerged from a simple observation: financial barriers were preventing millions from accessing quality mentorship and personalized learning opportunities.

Our founding volunteers, having witnessed talented individuals unable to afford professional mentorship, developed an innovative credit-based system where learners earn credits through engagement and redeem them for valuable mentorship sessions.

Today, we're proud to serve over 25,000 learners across 85 countries through our credit-based mentorship system, with learners having earned over 180,000 credits and completed 15,000+ personalized mentorship sessions.
