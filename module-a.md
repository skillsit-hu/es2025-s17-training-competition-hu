## Introduction

SkillShare Academy is a community-based digital learning platform that democratizes education through a free course marketplace and innovative credit-based mentor matching system. Learners earn 3-5 credits per completed course chapter and can use these credits to access personalized mentorship from expert mentors (rates vary from 5-15 credits per hour based on expertise level and specialization), creating a thriving ecosystem where skill development is accessible to everyone while rewarding learning progress.

This module focuses on creating a compelling static website that showcases SkillShare Academy's community-driven approach, free educational resources, credit-based mentorship system, volunteer mentor network, and skill assessment tools to attract both learners seeking growth and experts wanting to contribute to the community.
