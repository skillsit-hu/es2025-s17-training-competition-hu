# Test Project Outline – Module C – REST API

## Competition time

Competitors will have **3 hours** to complete module C.

## Introduction

Module C will focus on the implementation of a REST API.

    end
```

## General Description of Project and Tasks

Competitors will be asked to create a REST API for the SkillShare Academy learning platform. The API must be built with features that make it available publicly. The main goal of this backend is to serve the frontend, which will be used by learners to sign up for courses, learn, and attend mentoring sessions.

The API builds on top of the functionality created in module B, but there have been significant changes in the meantime. The content service - which provides all course information and content - has been separated from the user, credit, and mentor session management. The content service now runs as a separate service and is not publicly accessible as it lacks security and reliability. The code of the service will not be disclosed; instead, an OpenAPI specification and documentation will be provided.

In your backend, you must build code that wraps these APIs and exposes them through a single unified API on top of the user, credit, and mentor session management APIs.

A specification in OpenAPI format describes the required endpoints, authentication, and other requirements.

## Requirements

The API shall be implemented using one of the provided frameworks.

### Data Model

- The backend uses a **MySQL** database for data storage.
- It can be accessed at `db.ssa.skillsit.hu`, using port `3306` with the provided credentials.
- The database name follows the format: `competitor-c-YY`, where `YY` is your workstation number.

The database is currently empty. Use the given SQL dump in [`assets/module-c/db.sql`]('./assets/module-c/db.sql) to import the data. Please do not change the given tables and data, but you may extend the database schema to store additional data.

```mermaid

    User ||--o{ Enrollment : "enrolls in"
    User ||--o{ ChapterCompletion : "completes"
    User ||--o{ SessionBooking : "books"
    MentorSession ||--o{ SessionBooking : "booked for"

    User {
        BIGINT id PK
        STRING name
        STRING email UK
        STRING password
        ENUM role
        INT creditBalance
        DATETIME createdAt
        DATETIME updatedAt
    }

    ApiToken {
        BIGINT id PK
        BIGINT userId FK
        STRING token UK
        DATETIME revokedAt
        DATETIME createdAt
    }

    Enrollment {
        BIGINT id PK
        BIGINT userId FK
        BIGINT courseId "external reference"
        DATETIME enrolledAt
    }

    ChapterCompletion {
        BIGINT id PK
        BIGINT userId FK
        BIGINT chapterId "external reference"
        INT creditsEarned
        DATETIME completedAt
    }

    MentorSession {
        BIGINT id PK
        STRING mentorName "embedded mentor info"
        STRING expertise "embedded mentor info"
        ENUM experienceLevel "embedded mentor info"
        DATETIME sessionDate
        INT durationMinutes
        INT creditCost
        BOOLEAN isAvailable
        DATETIME createdAt
    }

    SessionBooking {
        BIGINT id PK
        BIGINT userId FK
        BIGINT sessionId FK
        ENUM status
        INT creditsPaid
        DATETIME bookedAt
    }
```

PHPMyAdmin is also available at `pma.ssa.skillsit.hu`.

**Provide a database SQL dump of the schema and data** that you are using in the `db/db-dump.sql` in your solution repo.

### Error Handling

There are several types of errors that can occur. The API endpoints must handle these errors and return the appropriate HTTP status code. The API endpoints must also return a JSON object with an error message.

Errors:

- `400` Bad Request: The request is malformed. This error shall be returned if the request is malformed or if the request is missing required fields.
- `401` Unauthorized: The user is not authorized to make the request. This error shall be returned if the token is invalid.
- `403` Forbidden: The user is not allowed to make the request. This error shall be returned if the credit limit is exceeded.
- `404` Not Found: The requested resource was not found. This error shall be returned if the requested course, session or booking was not found.
- `503` Service Unavailable: The service is not available. This error shall be returned if the learning service is not available or if the learning service returns an unexpected error.

### Endpoints to be implemented on the backend

#### General rules for the API

- Port: 80
- The response bodies contain some static example data. Dynamic data from the database should be used.
- Placeholder parameters in the URL are marked with a preceding colon _(e.g :slug)_
- The order of properties in objects does not matter, but the order in an array does.
- The `Content-Type` header of a response is always `application/json` unless specified otherwise.
- The given URLs are relative to the base URL of the API: `/api/v1`.
- All endpoints require endpoints must require an API token to be passed in the `X-API-TOKEN` header except for the following:

  - POST `/users/register`
  - POST `/users/login`

- In case of a missing or invalid token, the backend should return a `401 Unauthorized` response:

**Response:** 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid token"
}
```

- Pay attention to the defined HTTP status codes. The backend should return the correct status code for each endpoint.
- Implement the error handling as described in the API documentation. The backend should return the correct error message and status code for each endpoint.

A specification in OpenAPI format describes the required endpoints, authentication, and other requirements:
`assets/api/skillshare-academy-api.yml`

#### User Management API

##### POST /users/register

Register a new user. New users have 0 credits by default. An email address must be unique.

}
```

**Response (on success):** 201 Created

```json
{
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "credits": 0
  }
}
```

**Response (if email is already taken):** 400 Bad Request

```json
{
  "message": "Failed to register user"
}
```

---

#### POST /users/login

Login with email and password.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"

## Assessment

Module C will be assessed using tools which directly access the API created by competitors. The API will be tested for its functionality and its adherence to the specification. The API will also be tested for its security and reliability.
